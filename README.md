# 🏛️ Mystic Vault

A browser-based, team puzzle adventure game built with **React** for live college/school events and competitions. Teams race through encrypted ciphers, a dark maze, corrupted command sequences, and a final boss stage to unlock the vault — all against the clock.

## 🗄️ Supabase Database Setup

### Step 1 — Create a project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) → New Project
2. Give it a name → set a password → choose a region → Create

### Step 2 — Create the `teams` table
Go to **Table Editor** → **New Table** → name it `teams`

Add these columns:

| Column            | Type         | Notes              |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| `team_id`         | text         | Primary Key        |
| `password`        | text         |                    |
| `team_name`       | text         |                    |
| `current_round`   | int4         | Default: `1`       |
| `fragment1`       | text         |                    |
| `fragment2`       | text         |                    |
| `fragment3`       | text         |                    |
| `elapsed_seconds` | int4         |                    |
| `disqualified`    | bool         | Default: `false`   |
| `finish_time`     | timestamptz  |                    |
| `start_time`      | timestamptz  |                    |
| `last_updated`    | timestamptz  |                    |
| `maze_steps`      | int4         |                    |

### Step 3 — Disable Row Level Security (RLS)
> ⚠️ This is required or the game cannot read team data.

Go to **Databases and Storage → Firestore → teams table** → disable RLS.

Or run this in the **SQL Editor**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE teams DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Step 4 — Add your teams
In **Table Editor**, click **Insert Row** for each team:

| team_id  | password  | team_name    |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| TEAM-01  | vault2024 | Team Alpha   |
| TEAM-02  | shadow99  | Team Beta    |
| TEAM-03  | cipher7   | Team Gamma   |

To **change a password** mid-event → just edit the cell in Table Editor.  
To **disqualify a team** → set `disqualified` to `true`.

---

## ⚙️ Admin Panel

The Admin Panel lets you fully customise the game before the event.

### How to access
On the **Login screen**, enter:
- **Team ID:** `ADMIN`
- **Password:** `Admin`

> To change the admin credentials, open `src/pages/LoginScreen.js` and edit:
> ```js
> const ADMIN_ID   = 'ADMIN';
> const ADMIN_PASS = 'Admin';
> ```

### What you can customise

| Tab         | What you can change |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Difficulty  | Easy / Medium / Hard — affects maze size, visibility, number of puzzles and steps |
| Fragments   | The 3 words teams collect (these combine to form the final vault password) |
| Round 1     | Add/edit/remove cipher puzzles — question text, hint, and answer |
| Round 3     | Scrambled commands, correct answers, execution sequence order, and clue text |
| Boss Stage  | Symbol pool (emoji + label + ID), correct sequence order, and clue text |

---

## 🎮 Rounds Overview

### Round 1 — Cipher Gate
Teams solve text-based puzzles (Caesar ciphers, scrambled words, logic riddles). Each puzzle has a question, a hint, and an answer. All customisable via the Admin Panel.

### Round 2 — Dark Maze
Teams navigate a procedurally generated maze with limited visibility. A minimap in the corner gradually reveals explored paths. Maze size and visibility range change with difficulty.

### Round 3 — Command Override
**Step 1:** Teams unscramble corrupted commands by typing the correct version.  
**Step 2:** Teams drag and drop the commands into the correct execution order using the clue.  
Number of steps in the sequence changes with difficulty.

### Boss Stage — Vault Cipher
Teams select symbols from a pool in the exact order described in the clue. The number of symbols required changes with difficulty.

### Final Stage — Unlock the Vault
Teams combine their 3 collected fragments in the format `WORD-CODE-WORD` and submit it as the vault password.

## 🎚️ Difficulty Settings

| Setting | Cipher Puzzles | Maze Size | Visibility | Cmd Steps | Boss Symbols |
|---------|---------------|-----------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| Easy    | 2             | 11 × 9    | 4 cells    | 3         | 3            |
| Medium  | 3             | 15 × 11   | 3 cells    | 4         | 4            |
| Hard    | 3             | 19 × 15   | 2 cells    | 5         | 5            |

## 🔊 Sound Effects

The game uses the Web Audio API to generate sounds — no audio files needed:
- Click sounds on every interaction
- Success fanfare when a puzzle is solved
- Alarm buzz on wrong answers
- Vault-opening crescendo on victory
- Ambient background drone music during gameplay

Toggle sound with the **♪** button in the bottom-right corner.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "No teams found" on login | Disable RLS on the teams table in Supabase |
| "Team ID not found" | Check the `team_id` column matches exactly what you type |
| Maze not responding to keys | Click on the maze area first to give it focus |
| Admin panel not opening | Password is case-sensitive — use `Admin` not `admin` |
| Blank screen after build | Set the correct `homepage` in `package.json` for your deployment URL |

*Built for live college/school events. Single-page React app — deploy once, play anywhere.*

## Fix elapsed_seconds null issue

Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor to ensure the column type is correct:

```sql
-- Ensure elapsed_seconds is integer type (not text or null-typed)
ALTER TABLE teams ALTER COLUMN elapsed_seconds TYPE integer USING elapsed_seconds::integer;

-- Also ensure finish_time is timestamptz
ALTER TABLE teams ALTER COLUMN finish_time TYPE timestamptz USING finish_time::timestamptz;

-- Verify columns
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'teams';
```
